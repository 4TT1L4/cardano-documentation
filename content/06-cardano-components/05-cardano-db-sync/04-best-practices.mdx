This section outlines some best practices for using the Cardano DB Sync component.

### Having all software on the same machine

The recommended configuration is to have node, DB Sync, and PostgreSQL servers on the same machine. During syncing (getting historical data from the blockchain), there is a large amount of data traffic between db-sync and the database. Traffic to a local database is significantly faster than traffic to a database on the LAN or other remote location.

### SSD requirements

It is recommended that you have your SSD with more than 60,000 IOPS.

### Tuning DB Sync

For a better DB Sync experience, it is recommended that you fine-tune your PostgreSQL instance.

You can use [PGTune](https://pgtune.leopard.in.ua/) to generate a configuration file, which you can use to fine-tune your PostgreSQL instance.

To tune your database:

1.  Go to the [PGTune](https://pgtune.leopard.in.ua/) website.
2.  Provide basic information about your hardware configuration, which works with the PostgreSQL database.
3.  Click ‘Generate’. The system will calculate optimal results.
4.  Finally, replace your configuration with suggested numbers.

### Using snapshots

Blockchain size constantly increases with the number of new transactions and data added to the chain. The time to sync the whole blockchain increases appropriately. Every protocol upgrade presumes that database schemas are updated, which means that the database needs to be synced from scratch.

Cardano-db-sync snapshot comes as a solution to streamline the syncing process. This snapshot is compatible with both cardano-db-sync and cardano-db-sync with --no-epoch-table.

See how to efficiently use snapshots here:

### DB Sync maintenance

Here are some useful tips to maintain your database.

**Getting data from the tables**

On-chain data is stored in tables the mapping of which is structured (normalized) in a way that avoids data duplication. However, this also means that to extract certain data (like transaction information, for example), you will need to [join multiple tables in a query.](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/tutorial-join.html)

To show all tables, run this command:

`\dt`

To show details about a specific table:

`\d+ TABLE_NAME`

Use [SQL queries](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-db-sync/blob/master/doc/interesting-queries.md) to get the blockchain data you are looking for.

**Using DB management tools**

Another convenient way to explore database tables is to use a DB management tool like [https://www.pgadmin.org/](https://www.pgadmin.org/).

This tool allows browsing the tables and their definitions (like foreign key dependencies) or developing and executing complex queries.
